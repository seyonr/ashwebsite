                    <div class="hide">
                        <p>
                            Zena Algae is a 100% natural peel derived from quality Algae from Lakes of Ukraine! The seaweed 
                            powder contains natural micro-needles which will act on the epidermis and stimulate collagen production

                        <h4>How does it work?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Algae Peel utilizes the cutting-edge technology and unique properties of bioactive compounds naturally 
                            produced by specific marine algae (seaweed crystals) that penetrates and dissolve the epidermal layer of 
                            the skin, which reducing acne inflammation and reduces oil production. Seaweed contains tiny spicules 
                            crystal that penetrates the skin, dissolve the upper layer of the skin, reducing acne and lightening dark spots. 
                            The seaweed is blended with vitamins and minerals. Once applied onto the skin, the seaweed crystal will gently 
                            penetrates the skin for 5-10 mins. Resurfacing your skin with Algae Peel will result in more youthful and 
                            healthy-looking skin. It will deeply stimulate collagen and enhance your skin cells. On top of treating acne, 
                            it also decreases wrinkles caused by aging and commonly used as a dermabrasion medium.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Effects</h4>
                        <p>
                            The seaweed crystal remains inside your epidermal layer for 24-48 hours before dissolving. During that time, 
                            your skin will experience a mild redness. First few days after treatment, you will experience some dryness on 
                            the treated area. Subsequently, it will peel for 3-5 days. The seaweed crystal is stimulating the existing 
                            collagen and new epidermal cells are developing. After the healing process, new, rejuvenated skin will be revealed! 
                            After the overall peeling and shedding process has been completed, clients can see and feel major improvements in 
                            their skin's texture, skin tone and complexion.

                            instantly and continue to improve the following weeks. With ZERO to minimal flaking,

                <h4>Deep Cleansing</h4>
                <p>
                    Facials indeed play a crucial role in removing dirt, oil, and toxins from the skin, while also rejuvenating it
                    by eliminating bacteria that can lead to acne and other skin issues. Exfoliation, whether through traditional
                    methods or enhanced techniques, helps to reveal softer, smoother, and refreshed skin by sloughing off
                    dead cells and unclogging pores. This deep cleanse encourages the production of beneficial sebum and
                    collagen, promoting overall skin health and vitality.

            <div class="facial-info">
                <h4>Exfoliation</h4>
                <p>
                    Facials also include exfoliation, which is a key component that helps remove dead skin cells, revealing
                    smoother and more radiant skin underneath. By removing this outer layer of dead cells, exfoliation not
                    only enhances the skin's appearance but also improves the absorption of skincare products, allowing
                    them to work more effectively. Regular exfoliation through facials can indeed transform a dull complexion
                    and improve overall skin texture, leaving you with a brighter and more youthful glow.

                <h4>Customizable</h4>
                <p>

                    concerns and goals. Having a professional esthetician assess your skin allows for tailored treatments that

            <div class="facial-info">
                <h4>Rejuvenation</h4>
                <p>
                    Facials offer a comprehensive approach to skincare that results in fresh, renewed skin. The combination
                    of massage, exfoliation, and pore cleaning not only improves the appearance of the skin but also
                    enhances its overall health and vitality. Each step works synergistically to promote a glowing complexion
                    and radiance that may not have been present before. While one treatment may provide immediate
                    benefits, it's the continued and consistent approach to facials that leads to significant and remarkable
                    improvements in the skin over time. It's a journey towards achieving and maintaining healthy, beautiful
                    skin that's definitely worth investing in.

            <div class="facial-info">
                <h4>Stress Relief</h4>
                <p>
                    Facials offer not just skincare benefits but also a deeply relaxing and enjoyable experience. Allowing
                    someone to pamper your skin can indeed melt away stress and provide a much-needed opportunity to
                    unwind and recharge. The inclusion of a massage in facials further enhances this relaxation, as
                    massages are known to help relax the body and clear the mind. Just as the body benefits from
                    massages, facial muscles also benefit from stimulation to promote circulation and detoxification of the
                    skin. This boost in circulation contributes to a healthier and more youthful appearance. Taking time for
                    yourself to indulge in a facial not only pampers your skin but also provides a much-needed mental break,
                    allowing you to unwind and recharge. It's a wonderful way to prioritize self-care and enhance both your
                    physical and mental health.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="facial-info">
                <h4>All Skin Types and Concerns</h4>
                <p>
                    Regular facial treatments can address a wide range of skin issues and concerns, including blackheads,
                    whiteheads, pimples, sun damage, acne, inflammation, redness, rosacea, dehydration, wrinkles, acne
                    scarring, and loss of firmness and elasticity. By consistently stimulating, cleansing, replacing, and
                    hydrating the skin on your face, you can achieve healthier and more radiant skin that truly glows. The
                    tailored approach of facials allows for targeted treatments that address specific skin needs, resulting in
                    noticeable improvements in skin texture, tone, and overall appearance over time. It&#39;s a proactive
                    investment in your skin health and beauty that yields long-lasting benefits.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="facial-info">
                <h4>Anti-Aging</h4>
                <p>
                    Facial treatments can play a significant role in slowing down the aging process and minimizing the
                    formation of wrinkles. The facial massage, especially when combined with anti-aging products, enhances
                    blood circulation and oxygen flow to the skin, thereby stimulating collagen production and improving skin
                    elasticity. This ultimately results in a reduction of fine lines and wrinkles, as well as a more youthful and
                    rejuvenated appearance. It's a proactive approach to skincare that can yield noticeable improvements in
                    skin texture and tone over time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Also, most of our facials at Skin Bar by Ash include anti-aging ingredients like antioxidants, peptides, and
                    collagen in facials can indeed work wonders for reducing the signs of aging, such as fine lines and
                    wrinkles, while also enhancing skin elasticity. Consistent use of these ingredients through regular facials
                    can help maintain a youthful and vibrant complexion, making them a valuable addition to any skincare
                    routine, especially for those concerned about aging skin.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="facial-info">
                <h4>How Often Should You Get a Facial?</h4>
                <p>
                    The recommended frequency of facials, typically every 4-6 weeks, aligns with the natural skin cell
                    turnover cycle, ensuring consistent rejuvenation and maintenance of skin health. However, individual skin
                    types and needs may warrant adjustments to this timeframe. Oily or acne-prone skin may benefit from
                    more frequent facials to manage excess oil and breakouts, while sensitive skin may require longer
                    intervals between treatments to prevent irritation.
                </p>

                <p>Day 1: Immediate improvement! Skin is glowing, hydrated, rejuvenated and nourished</p>
                <p>Day 2-3: Your skin will be looking plumper thanks to the booster circulation from your facial</p>
                <p>Day 21-28: Your cells have begun to regenerate, and you can see full benefits from your facial</p>
                <p>
                    Week 4-6: The natural skin cell turnover cycle is around 28 days, so getting a facial every 4-6
                    weeks will help to keep your skin looking fresh and rejuvenated
